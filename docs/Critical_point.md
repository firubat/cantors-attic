## Critical Point

Given two structures $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, loosely
speaking, the *critical point* is the smallest element in $\mathcal{M}$
which is similar to a larger element in $\mathcal{N}$. The actual
definition can only be told if both structures' universes are transitive
classes containing ordinals.

## Formal Definition

Given two transitive classes $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, and an
elementary embedding $j:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}$, the
critical point of $j$ (often denoted $\mathrm{cp}(j)$) is the smallest
ordinal $\alpha$ in $\mathrm{M}$ such that $\alpha\neq j(\alpha)$.

## Use in Large Cardinal Axioms

Critical points are used in Large Cardinal Axioms to make very large
$\mathrm{M}$ such that $j:V\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$ is an elementary
embedding. The closer $\mathcal{M}$ gets to $V$, the closer one is to
proving the Wholeness Axiom. Assuming this embedding has a critical
point, one gets closer to a

cardinal, which is inconsistent with the Axiom of Choice. Thus, the
following axioms mention critical points:

    -   [n-huge](Huge "Huge")
    -   [super-n-huge](Huge "Huge")
    -   [$\omega$-huge](Huge "Huge")
-   High jump cardinals:
    -   [almost

    -   [high-jump](High-jump "High-jump")
    -   [super
        high-jump](High-jump "High-jump")
    -   [high-jump with unbounded excess
        closure](High-jump "High-jump")
