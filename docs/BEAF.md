BEAF, or Bowers Exploding Array function, is an extremely fast-growing
function.

## Definitions

-   The "base" (*b*) is the first entry in the array.
-   The "prime" (*p*) is the second entry in the array.
-   The "pilot" is the first non-1 entry after the prime. It can be as
    early as the third entry.
-   The "copilot" is the entry immediately before the pilot. The copilot
    does not exist if the pilot is the first entry in its row.
-   A "structure" is a part of the array that consists of a
    lower-dimensional group. This could be an entry (written \(X^0\)),
    a row (written \(X^1\)), a plane (\(X^2\)), a realm (\(X^3\)),
    or a flune (\(X^4\)), not to mention higher-dimensional structures
    (\(X^5\), \(X^6\), etc.) and
    <a href="index.php?title=Tetration&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Tetration (page does not exist)">tetrational</a>
    structures, e.g. \(X\uparrow\uparrow 3\). We can also continue
    with
    <a href="index.php?title=Pentation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pentation (page does not exist)">pentational</a>,
    <a href="index.php?title=Hexation&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hexation (page does not exist)">hexational</a>,
    ...,
    <a href="index.php?title=Expansion&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Expansion (page does not exist)">expandal</a>,
    ... structures.
-   A "previous entry" is an entry that occurs before the pilot, but is
    on the same row as all other previous entries. A "previous row" is a
    row that occurs before the pilot's row, but is on the same plane as
    all other previous rows. A "previous plane" is a plane that occurs
    before the pilot's plane, but is on the same realm as all other
    previous planes, etc. These are called "previous structures."
-   A "prime block" of a structure \(S\) is computed by replacing all
    instances of \(X\) with \(p\). For example, if \(S = X^3\),
    the prime block is \(p^3\), or a cube of side length \(p\). The
    prime block of an \(X^X\) structure is \(p^p\), a
    \(p\)-hypercube with sidelength \(p\).
-   The "airplane" includes the pilot, all previous entries, and the
    prime block of all previous structures.
-   The "passengers" are the entries in the airplane that are not the
    pilot or copilot.
-   The value of the array is notated \(v(A)\), where *A* is the
    array.

## Rules

1.  *Prime rule*: If \(p = 1\), \(v(A) = b\).
2.  *Initial rule*: If there is no pilot, \(v(A) = b^p\).
3.  *Catastrophic rule*: If neither 1 nor 2 apply, then:
    1.  pilot decreases by 1,
    2.  copilot takes on the value of the original array with the prime
        decreased by 1,
    3.  each passenger becomes *b*,
    4.  and the rest of the array remains unchanged.

Using {a, b, ... (1) c, d, ...} to denote

       {a, b, ...}
       {c, d, ...}

a 2-dimensional array (For example, $\{3,3,3 (1) 3,3,3 (1) 3,3,3\}$
means a 3-by-3 square of threes):

\begin{eqnarray*} \{3,3(1)3,3\} &=& \{3,3,3(1)2,3\} \\ &=&

More generally, (n) is typically used as a separator representing a
line/plane/... shift in a n-dimensional array.

BEAF is however formally undefined past (n)-separators. In particular,
the so-called "tetrational" arrays are not defined, contrary to popular
belief.
