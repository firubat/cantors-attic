Stability was developed as a large countable ordinal property in order
to try to generalize the different strengthened variants of
[admissibility](Admissible "Admissible").
More specifically, they capture the various assertions that
$L_\alpha\models\text{KP}+A$ for different axioms $A$ by saying that
$L_\alpha\models\text{KP}+A$ for many axioms $A$. One could also
argue that stability is a weakening of
[$\Sigma_1$-correctness](Reflecting "Reflecting")
(which is trivial) to a nontrivial form.

## Definition and Variants

Stability is defined using a reflection principle. A countable ordinal
$\alpha$ is called **stable** iff $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_1}L$;
equivalently, $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_{\omega_1}$.

### Variants

There are quite a few (weakened) variants of
stability:{% cite Madore2017 %}

-   A countable ordinal $\alpha$ is called **$(+\beta)$-stable** iff
    $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_{\alpha+\beta}$.
-   A countable ordinal $\alpha$ is called **$({}^+)$-stable** iff
    $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is the
    least
    [admissible](Admissible "Admissible")
    ordinal larger than $\alpha$.
-   A countable ordinal $\alpha$ is called **$({}^{++})$-stable** iff
    $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is the
    least admissible ordinal larger than an admissible ordinal larger
    than $\alpha$.
-   A countable ordinal $\alpha$ is called **inaccessibly-stable** iff
    $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is the
    least [computably
    inaccessible](Admissible "Admissible")
    ordinal larger than $\alpha$.
-   A countable ordinal $\alpha$ is called **Mahlo-stable** iff
    $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is the
    least [computably
    Mahlo](Admissible "Admissible")
    ordinal larger than $\alpha$; that is, the least $\beta$ such that
    any $\beta$-recursive function $f:\beta\rightarrow\beta$ has an
    admissible $\gamma<\beta$ which is closed under $f$.
-   A countable ordinal $\alpha$ is called **doubly $(+1)$-stable** iff
    there is a $(+1)$-stable ordinal $\beta>\alpha$ such that
    $L_\alpha\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_\beta$.
-   A countable ordinal $\alpha$ is called **nonprojectible** iff the
    set of all $\beta<\alpha$ such that
    $L_\beta\prec_{\Sigma_1}L_\alpha$ is unbounded in $\alpha$.

## Properties

Any $L$-stable ordinal is stable. This is because
$L_\alpha^L=L_\alpha$ and $L^L=L$.
{% cite Jech2003 %} Any $L$-countable stable ordinal is
$L$-stable for the same reason. Therefore, an ordinal is $L$-stable iff
it is $L$-countable and stable. This property is the same for all
variants of stability.

The smallest stable ordinal is also the smallest ordinal $\alpha$ such
that $L_\alpha\models\text{KP}+\Sigma_2^1\text{-reflection}$,
which in turn is the smallest ordinal which is not the order-type of any
$\Delta_2^1$-ordering of the natural numbers. The smallest stable
ordinal $\sigma$ has the property that any $\Sigma_1(L_\sigma)$
subset of $\omega$ is $\omega$-finite.

If there is an ordinal $\eta$ such that $L_\eta\models\text{ZFC}$
(i.e. the minimal height of a
<a href="Transitive_ZFC_model" class="mw-redirect" title="Transitive ZFC model">transitive model of $\text{ZFC}$</a>)
then it is smaller than the least stable ordinal. On the other hand, the
sizes of the least $(+1)$-stable ordinal and the least nonprojectible
ordinal lie between the least recursively weakly compact and the least
$Î£_2$-admissible (the same for other weakened variants of stability
defined above). {% cite Madore2017 %}
