The *Church-Kleene* ordinal $\omega_1^{ck}$ is the supremum of the
computable ordinals, where an ordinal $\alpha$ is *computable* if there
is a computable relation $\lhd$ on $\mathbb{N}$ of order type
$\alpha$, that is, such that
$\langle\alpha,\lt\rangle\cong\langle\mathbb{N},\lhd\rangle$.

This ordinal is closed under all of the elementary ordinal arithmetic
operations, such as successor, addition, multiplication and
exponentiation.

The Church-Kleene ordinal is the least
[admissible](Admissible "Admissible")
ordinal.

## Relativized Church-Kleene ordinal

The Church-Kleene idea easily relativizes to oracles, where for any real
$x$, we define $\omega_1^x$ to be the supremum of the $x$-computable
ordinals. This is also the least
[admissible](Admissible "Admissible")
ordinal relative to $x$, and every countable successor admissible
ordinal is $\omega_1^x$ for some $x$.
