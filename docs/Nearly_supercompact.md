title: Nearly $\theta$-supercompact cardinals
permalink: Nearly_supercompact

The near $\theta$-supercompactness hierarchy of cardinals was
introduced by Jason Schanker in
{% cite Schanker2012 %} and
{% cite Schanker2011a %}. The hierarchy stratifies the
$\theta$-supercompactness hierarchy in the sense that every
$\theta$-supercompact cardinal is nearly $\theta$-supercompact, and
every nearly $2^{\theta^{ {<}\kappa}}$-supercompact cardinal
$\kappa$ is $\theta$-supercompact. However, these cardinals can be
very different. For example, relative to the existence of a supercompact
cardinal $\kappa$ with an inaccessible cardinal $\theta$ above it, we
can force to destroy $\kappa$'s measurability while still retaining its
near $\theta$-supercompactness and the
<a href="Weakly_inaccessible" class="mw-redirect" title="Weakly inaccessible">weak inaccessibility</a>
of $\theta$. Yet, if $\theta^{ {<}\kappa} = \theta$ and $\kappa$
is $\theta$-supercompact, we can also force to preserve $\kappa$'s
$\theta$-supercompactness while destroying any potential near
$\theta^+$-supercompactness without collapsing cardinals below
$\theta^{++}$. Assuming that $\theta^{ {<}\kappa} = \theta$,
nearly $\theta$-supercompact cardinals $\kappa$ exhibit a hybrid of
[weak
compactness](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact")
and
[supercompactness](Supercompact "Supercompact")
in that the witnessing
[embeddings](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
are between $\text{ZFC}^-$ ($\text{ZFC}$ minus the powerset axiom)
models of size $\theta$ but are generated by "partially normal" fine
[filters](Filter "Filter")
on $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(\theta$). [Weakly
compact](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact")
cardinals $\kappa$ are nearly $\kappa$-supercompact.

## Formal definition

A cardinal $\kappa$ is *nearly $\theta$-supercompact* if and only if
for every $A\subseteq\theta$, there exists a transitive $M \vDash
ZFC^{-}$ closed under ${<}\kappa$ sequences with $A, \kappa,
\theta \in M$, a transitive $N$, and an [elementary
embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
$j: M \rightarrow N$ with critical point $\kappa$ such that
$j(\kappa) > \theta$ and $j''\theta \in N$. A cardinal is *nearly
supercompact* if it is nearly $\theta$-supercompact for all $\theta$.

## Characterizations of near $\theta$-supercompactness

If $\theta^{ {<}\kappa} = \theta$, then the following are
equivalent characterizations for the near $\theta$-supercompactness of
$\kappa$:

Embedding   
For every ${<}\kappa$-closed transitive set $M$ of size $\theta$
with $\theta \in M$, there exists a transitive $N$ and an elementary
embedding $j: M \rightarrow N$ with critical point $\kappa$ such that
$j(\kappa) > \theta$ and $j''\theta \in N$.


Normal Embedding   


Normal ZFC Embedding   


Normal Fine Filter   
For every family of subsets $\mathcal{A} \subset
\mathcal{P}_\kappa(\theta)$ of size at most $\theta$ and every
collection $\mathcal{F}$ of at most $\theta$ many functions from
$\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(\theta)$ into $\theta$, there exists a
$\kappa$-complete fine
[filter](Filter "Filter")
$F$ on $\mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(\theta)$, which is
$\mathcal{F}$-normal in the sense that for every $f \in \mathcal{F}$
that's regressive on some set in $F$, there exists $\alpha_f <
\theta$ for which $\{\sigma \in \mathcal{P}_{\kappa}(\theta)\|
f(\sigma) = \alpha_f\} \in F$.
