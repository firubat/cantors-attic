Shrewd cardinals are a generalisation of indescribable cardinals. They
are called shrewd because they are bigger in size than many large
cardinals which much greater consistency strength (for all notions of
large cardinal which do not make reference to the totality of all
ordinals).

## Definitions

$κ$ — cardinal, $η>0$ — ordinal, $\mathcal{A}$ — class.

$κ$ is $η$-shrewd iff for all $X ⊆ V_κ$ and for every formula
$\phi(x_1, x_2)$, if $V_{κ+η} \models \phi(X, κ)$, then
$\exists_{0 < κ_0, η_0 < κ} V_{κ_0+η_0} \models \phi(X ∩
V_{κ_0}, κ_0)$.

$κ$ is shrewd iff $κ$ is $η$-shrewd for every $η > 0$.

$κ$ is $\mathcal{A}$-$η$-shrewd iff for all $X ⊆ V_κ$ and for every
formula $\phi(x_1, x_2)$, if $\langle V_{κ+η}, \mathcal{A} ∩
V_{κ+η} \rangle \models \phi(X, κ)$, then $\exists_{0 < κ_0,
η_0 < κ} \langle V_{κ_0+η_0}, \mathcal{A} ∩ V_{κ_0+η_0}
\rangle \models \phi(X ∩ V_{κ_0}, κ_0)$.

$κ$ is $\mathcal{A}$-shrewd iff $κ$ is $\mathcal{A}$-$η$-shrewd for
every $η > 0$.

One can also use a collection of formulae $\mathcal{F}$ and make
$\phi$ an $\mathcal{F}$-formula to define $η$-$\mathcal{F}$-shrewd
and $\mathcal{A}$-$η$-$\mathcal{F}$-shrewd cardinals.

## Properties

-   If $κ$ is $\mathcal{A}$-$δ$-shrewd and $0 < η < δ$, then $κ$
    is $\mathcal{A}$-$η$-shrewd. This is a difference between the
    properties of shrewdness and indescribability.

    $\pi$,
    -   for every class $\mathcal{A}$, in every club $B ⊆ π$ there is
        $κ$ such that $\langle V_\pi, \mathcal{A} ∩ V_\pi \rangle
        \models \text{“$κ$ is $\mathcal{A}$-shrewd .”}$. (The set of
        cardinals $κ$ below $\pi$ that are $\mathcal{A}$-shrewd in
        $V_\pi$ is stationary.)
    -   there is an $\eta$-shrewd cardinal below $\pi$ for all $\eta
        < \pi$.
