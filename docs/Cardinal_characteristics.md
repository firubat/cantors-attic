The subject known as *cardinal characteristics of the continuum*
explores the rich territory---sometimes hidden from view, depending on
the set-theoretic background---between the [countably
infinite](Omega "Omega")
cardinal $\aleph_0$ and the
<a href="Uncountable" class="mw-redirect" title="Uncountable">uncountable</a>
cardinality of the
[continuum](Continuum "Continuum").
The subject begins with Cantor's theorem laying out the basic dichotomy
that the continuum $\frak{c}=2^{\aleph_0}$ is strictly larger than
$\aleph_0$, and goes on to explore the various ways that properties of
<a href="Aleph_zero" class="mw-redirect" title="Aleph zero">$\aleph_0$</a>
might extend to uncountable cardinals.

For example, the union of countably many measure zero subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$ has measure $0$; the union of countably many meager sets
is meager; every countable number of functions $f:\omega\to\omega$ is
bounded by a single function under eventual domination; every countable
set of reals has measure $0$. To what extent can we hope to extend such
properties to uncountable collections? The various cardinal
characteristics of the continuum, many of which are described below, are
defined exactly to be the cardinalities where these and other similar
such properties first begin to fail for uncountable collections. Each
cardinal characteristic measures the extent to which a particular
mathematical phenomenon extends from the countable to the uncountable,
and the lesson of the subject is that there is an enormous diversity of
such characteristics, exhibiting diverse combinations in various models
of set theory. When the continuum is small, the characteristics are
pressed together---under the
<a href="Continuum_hypothesis" class="mw-redirect" title="Continuum hypothesis">continuum hypothesis</a>,
for example, they are all equal to the continuum---but in other models,
the different characteristics are teased apart and seen to express
fundamentally different inequivalent properties. The subject breaks into
two major components: first, proving the positive relations amongs the
characteristics, such as
$\omega_1\leq\frak{b}\leq\frak{d}\leq\frak{c}$; and second,
constructing models of set theory, generally by
[forcing](Forcing "Forcing"),
which reveal the range of possibility, such as a model in which
$\omega_1\lt\frak{b}\lt\frak{d}\lt\frak{c}$. Thus, the
philosophy of the subject naturally exhibits an unusual degree of
contingency for set-theoretic truth: we understand the cardinal
characteristic more deeply because we know the range of possibility for
their relations to each other.

## The bounding number

The *bounding number* $\frak{b}$ is the size of the smallest family of
functions $f:\omega\to\omega$ that is not bounded with respect to
eventual domination.

## The dominating number

The *dominating number* $\frak{d}$ is the size of the smallest family
of functions $f:\omega\to\omega$, such that every function is
eventually dominated by a function in the family.

  

## The covering numbers

## The additivity numbers
