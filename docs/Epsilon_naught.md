The ordinal $\epsilon_0$, commonly given the British pronunciation
"epsilon naught," is the smallest ordinal $\alpha$ for which
$\alpha=\omega^\alpha$ and can be equivalently characterized as the
supremum

$$\epsilon_0=\sup\{\omega,\omega^\omega,\omega^{\omega^\omega},\ldots\}$$

The [ordinals below
$\epsilon_0$](Small_countable_ordinals "Small countable ordinals")
exhibit an attractive finitistic normal form of representation, arising
from an iterated Cantor normal form involving only finite numbers and
the expression $\omega$ in finitely iterated exponentials, products and
sums.

The ordinal $\epsilon_0$ arises in diverse proof-theoretic contexts.
For example, it is the proof-theoretic ordinal of the first-order Peano
axioms.

## Epsilon numbers

The ordinal $\epsilon_0$ is the first ordinal in the hierarchy of
$\epsilon$-numbers, where $\epsilon_\alpha$ is the $\alpha^{\rm
th}$ fixed point of the exponential function
$\beta\mapsto\omega^\beta$. These can also be defined inductively,
as
$\epsilon_{\alpha+1}=\sup\{\epsilon_\alpha+1,\omega^{\epsilon_\alpha+1},\omega^{\omega^{\epsilon_\alpha+1}},\ldots\}$,
and $\epsilon_\lambda=\sup_{\alpha\lt\lambda}\epsilon_\alpha$
for limit ordinals $\lambda$. The epsilon numbers therefore form an
increasing continuous sequence of ordinals. Every uncountable infinite
cardinal $\kappa$ is an epsilon number fixed point
$\kappa=\epsilon_\kappa$.
