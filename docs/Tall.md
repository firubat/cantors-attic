## Tall Cardinals

A cardinal $\kappa$ is **$\theta$-tall** iff there is an [elementary
embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
$j:V\to M$ into a transitive class $M$ with critical point $\kappa$
such that $j(\kappa)>\theta$ and $M^\kappa\subset M$. $\kappa$
is **tall** iff it is $\theta$-tall for every $\theta$; i.e.
$j(\kappa)$ can be made arbitrarily large. Every
[strong](Strong "Strong")
cardinal is tall and every [strongly
compact](Strongly_compact "Strongly compact")
cardinal is tall, but
[measurable](Measurable "Measurable")
cardinals are not necessarily tall. It is relatively consistent,
however, that the least measurable cardinal is tall. Nevertheless, the
existence of a tall cardinal is equiconsistent with the existence of a
[strong](Strong "Strong")
cardinal. Any tall cardinal $\kappa$ can be made indestructible by a
variety of forcing notions, including forcing that pumps up the value of
$2^\kappa$ as high as desired. See

### Extender Characterization

If $\theta$ is a cardinal, $\kappa$ is $\theta$-tall iff there exists
some $(\kappa,\theta^+)$-extender $E$ such that, if $M\cong Ult_E$
is the ultrapower of $V$ by $E$, $M^\kappa\subset M$. Similarly,
$\kappa$ is tall iff for any $\lambda$ there exists some
$(\kappa,\lambda)$-extender such that $M^\kappa\subset M$ where $M$
is as above.

## Strongly Tall Cardinals

A cardinal $\kappa$ is **strongly $\theta$-tall** iff there is some
[measure](Filter "Filter")
$U$ on a set $S$ witnessing $\kappa$'s $\theta$-tallness in the
ultrapower of $V$ by $U$. More precisely, the ultrapower embedding
$j:V\prec M$ has critical point $\kappa$, $M^\kappa\subset M$, and
$j(\kappa)>\theta$. $\kappa$ is **strongly tall** iff it is
strongly $\theta$-tall for every $\theta$.

The existence of a strongly tall cardinal is equiconsistent to the
existence of a strong cardinal with a proper class of measurables above
it (below the consistency strength of a
[Woodin](Woodin "Woodin")
cardinal, above the consistency strength of a
[strong](Strong "Strong")
cardinal and therefore above a tall cardinal). Specifically, if $κ$ is
strong and has a proper class of measurables above it and
<a href="Continuum_hypothesis" class="mw-redirect" title="Continuum hypothesis">GCH</a>
holds, then in a forcing extension of $V$, $κ$ is strongly tall. On the
other hand, if $κ$ is strongly tall and there is no inner model with two
strong cardinals, then $κ$ is strong in $K$ and has a proper class of
measurables above it in $K$ ($K$ being the [core
model](Core_model "Core model")).

### Ultrapower Characterization

$\kappa$ is strongly $\theta$-tall iff $\kappa$ is uncountable and
there is some set $S$ and a $\kappa$-complete
[ultrafilter](Filter "Filter")
$U$ on $S$ such that, letting $j:V\prec M\cong Ult_U(V)$,
$j(\kappa)>\theta$. That is, there is an ultrapower of an
ultrafilter which witnesses the $\gamma$-tallness of $\kappa$.

### Embedding Characterization

If $\theta\geq\kappa$, then $\kappa$ is strongly $\theta$-tall iff
$\kappa$ is the critical point of some $j:V\prec M$ for which there is
a set $S$ and an $A\in j(S)$ such that for any $\alpha\leq\theta$,
there is a function $f:S\rightarrow\kappa$ with $j(f)(A)=\alpha$.

### Ultrafilter Characterization

$\kappa$ is strongly $\theta$-tall iff there is some set $S$, a
$\kappa$-complete
[ultrafilter](Filter "Filter")
$U$ on $S$, and a class $H$ of functions $H_\alpha:S\rightarrow V$
for each ordinal $\alpha$ such that:

1.  $\kappa$ is uncountable.
2.  $H_0(x)=0$ for each $x\in S$.
3.  For each $\alpha$ and each $f:S\rightarrow V$, $\{x\in
    S:f(x)\in H_\alpha(x)\}\in U$ iff there is some
    $\beta<\alpha$ such that $\{x\in S:f(x)=H_\beta(x)\}\in
    U$. That is, $f(x)\in H_\alpha(x)$ almost everywhere iff there is
    some $\beta<\alpha$ such that $f(x)=H_\beta(x)$ almost
    everywhere.
4.  $\{x\in S:H_\theta(x)\in\kappa\}\in U$. That is,
    $H_\theta(x)\in\kappa$ almost everywhere.
