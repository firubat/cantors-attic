*Hypercompactness* is a large cardinal property that is a strengthening
of
[supercompactness](Supercompact "Supercompact").
A cardinal $\kappa$ is *$\alpha$-hypercompact* if and only if for
every ordinal $\beta < \alpha$ and for every cardinal
$\lambda\geq\kappa$, there exists a cardinal $\lambda'\geq\lambda$
and an elementary embedding $j:V\to M$ generated by a [normal fine
ultrafilter](Filter "Filter")
on $P_\kappa\lambda$ such that $\kappa$ is $\beta$-hypercompact in
$M$. $\kappa$ is *hypercompact* if and only if it is
$\beta$-hypercompact for every ordinal $\beta$.

Every cardinal is 0-hypercompact, and 1-hypercompactness is equivalent
to supercompactness.
