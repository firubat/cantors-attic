Vopěnka's principle is a large cardinal axiom at the upper end of the
large cardinal hierarchy that is particularly notable for its
applications to category theory. In a set theoretic setting, the most
common definition is the following:

> For any language $\mathcal{L}$ and any proper class $C$ of
> $\mathcal{L}$-structures, there are distinct structures $M, N\in C$
> and an [elementary
> embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
> $j:M\to N$.

For example, taking $\mathcal{L}$ to be the language with one unary and
one binary predicate, we can consider for any ordinal $\eta$ the class
of structures $\langle V_{\alpha+\eta},\{\alpha\},\in\rangle$,
and conclude from Vopěnka's principle that a cardinal that is at least
$\eta$-[extendible](Extendible "Extendible")
exists. In fact if Vopěnka's principle holds then there is a stationary
proper class of extendible cardinals; bounding the strength of the axiom
from above, we have that if $\kappa$ is [almost
huge](Huge#Almost_huge "Huge"),
or even
[almost-high-jump](High-jump "High-jump"),
then $V_\kappa$ satisfies Vopěnka's principle.


## Formalizations

As stated above and from the point of view of ZFC, this is actually an
axiom schema, as we quantify over proper classes, which from a purely
ZFC perspective means definable proper classes. A somewhat stronger
alternative is to view Vopěnka's principle as an axiom in second-order
set theory capable to dealing with proper classes, such as von
Neumann-Gödel-Bernays set theory. This is a strictly stronger assertion.
<a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/45602/can-vopenkas-principle-be-violated-definably" class="external autonumber">[1]</a>
Finally, one may relativize the principle to a particular cardinal,
leading to the concept of a Vopěnka cardinal.

Vopěnka's principle can be formalized in first-order set theory as a
schema, where for each natural number $n$ in the meta-theory there is a
formula expressing that Vopěnka’s Principle holds for all
$Σ_n$-definable (with parameters)
classes.{% cite Bagaria2012 %}

Vopěnka principle VP and the Vopěnka scheme VS are not equivalent, but
they are equiconsistent and have the same first-order consequences
(GBC+VP is conservative over GBC+VS and ZFC+VS, VP makes no sense in the
context of ZFC):{% cite Hamkins2016 %}

-   If ZFC and the Vopěnka scheme holds, then there is a class forcing
    extension, adding classes but no sets, in which GBC and the Vopěnka
    scheme holds, but the Vopěnka principle fails.
-   If ZFC and the Vopěnka scheme holds, then there is a class forcing
    extension, adding classes but no sets, in which GBC and the Vopěnka
    principle holds.

Vopěnka cardinal is an inaccessible cardinal $δ$ such that $\langle
V_δ , ∈, V_{δ+1} \rangle$ is a model of VP (and the Morse–Kelley set
theory). Vopěnka-scheme cardinal is a cardinal $δ$ such that $\langle
V_δ , ∈ \rangle$ is a model of
ZFC+VS.{% cite Hamkins2016 %}

## Vopěnka cardinals

An inaccessible cardinal $\kappa$ is a *Vopěnka cardinal* if and only
if $V_\kappa$ satisfies Vopěnka's principle, that is, where we
interpret the proper classes of $V_\kappa$ as the subsets of
$V_\kappa$ of cardinality $\kappa$. Because of a characterization of
Vopěnka's principle in terms of graphs, a cardinal $\kappa$ is Vopěnka
if and only if $\kappa$ is inaccessible and any set $\kappa$-sized set
$G$ of $<\kappa$-sized nonisomorphic graphs has some $g_0$ and
$g_1$ with $g_0$ a proper subgraph of $g_1$. (Need to cite sources)

Perlmutter
{% cite Perlmutter2010 %}
proved that a cardinal is a Vopěnka cardinal if and only if it is a
[Woodin for
supercompactness](Woodin "Woodin")
cardinal.

As we mentioned above, every almost huge cardinal is a Vopěnka cardinal.

## Equivalent statements

### Extendible cardinals

The schema form of Vopěnka's principle is equivalent to the existence of
a proper class of
$C^{(n)}$-[extendible](Extendible "Extendible")
cardinals for every $n$; indeed there is a level-by-level stratification
of Vopěnka's principle, with Vopěnka's principle for a
$\Sigma_{n+2}$-definable class corresponds to the existence of a
$C^{(n)}$-extendible cardinal greater than the ranks of the parameters
(see section "Variants”).
{% cite Bagaria %}

The Vopěnka principle is equivalent over GBC to both following
statements:{% cite Hamkins2016 %}

-   For every class $A$, there is an $A$-extendible cardinal.
-   For every class $A$, there is a stationary proper class of
    $A$-extendible cardinals.

### Strong Compactness of Logics

Vopěnka's principle is equivalent to the following statement about
logics as well:

For every logic $\mathcal{L}$, there is a cardinal
$\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ such that for any language $\tau$ and any
$\mathcal{L}(\tau)$-theory $T$, $T$ is satisfiable if and only if
every $t\subseteq T$ such that $\|t\|<\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ is
satisfiable. {% cite Makowsky1985 %}

This $\mu_{\mathcal{L}}$ is called the strong compactness cardinal of
$\mathcal{L}$. Vopěnka's principle therefore is equivalent to every
logic having a strong compactness cardinal. This is very similar in
definition to the Löwenheim–Skolem number of $\mathcal{L}$, although it
is not guaranteed to exist.

Here are some examples of strong compactness cardinals of specific
logics:

-   If $\kappa\leq\lambda$ and $\lambda$ is [strongly
    compact](Strongly_compact "Strongly compact")
    or $\aleph_0$, then the strong compactness cardinal of
    [$\mathcal{L}_{\kappa,\kappa}$](Infinitary_logic "Infinitary logic")
    is at most $\lambda$.
-   Similarly, if $\kappa\leq\lambda$ and $\lambda$ is
    [extendible](Extendible "Extendible"),
    then for any natural number $n$, the strong compactness cardinal of
    $\mathcal{L}^n_{\kappa,\kappa}$
    ($\mathcal{L}_{\kappa,\kappa}$ with $n+1$-th order logic) is at
    most $\lambda$. Therefore for any natural number $n$, the strong
    compactness cardinal of $n+1$-th order finitary logic is at most the
    least extendible cardinal.

### Locally Presentable Categories

Vopěnka's principle is equivalent to the axiom stating "no large full
subcategory $C$ of any locally presentable category is discrete."
(Sources needed). Equivalently, no large full subcategory of Graph (the
category of all graphs) is discrete; that is, for any proper class of
simple directed graphs, there is at least one pair of nonequal graphs
$G$ and $H$ in the class such that $G$ is a subgraph of $H$. This is a
$\Pi^1_1$ statement, so the least Vopěnka cardinals are not even
[weakly
compact](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact")
(although the least weakly compact cardinal is much, much, much smaller
than the least Vopěnka cardinal, if it exists).

Intuitively, a "category" is just a class of mathematical objects with
some notion of "morphism", "homomorphism", "isomorphism", (etc.). For
example, in Set, the category of all sets, homomorphisms are just
injections, and isomorphisms are bijections. In categories of groups and
models, homomorphisms and isomorphisms share their actual names.

A "locally small category" $C$ is one with only set-many morphisms
between any two objects of $C$. This is one where the objects of $C$
behave "set-like" in the sense that, usually, the number of morphisms
between two set-sized objects is at most the number of functions between
their universes (like in groups and in graphs). A "locally presentable
category" is a locally small category with a couple more really nice
properties; you can "generate" all of the objects from set-many objects
in the category.

Vopěnka's principle intuitively states that if you have a locally
presentable category $C$, then any proper class of objects of $C$ has
some nonisomorphic objects $c$ and $d$ where $c$ has a morphism into
$d$.

### Woodin cardinals

There is a strange connection between the
[Woodin](Woodin "Woodin")
cardinals and the Vopěnka cardinals. In particular, Vopěnkaness is
equivalent to two strengthening variants of Woodinness, namely the
[Woodin for
Supercompactness](Woodin#Shelah "Woodin")
cardinals and the
<a href="N-fold_Woodin" class="mw-redirect" title="N-fold Woodin">$2$-fold Woodin</a>
cardinals. As a result, every Vopěnka cardinal is Woodin.

### Elementary Embeddings Between Ranks

An equivalent statement to Vopěnka's principle is that for any proper
class $C\subseteq ORD$, there are $\alpha\in C$, $\beta\in C$, and
a nontrivial [elementary
embedding](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding")
$j:\langle V_\alpha;\in,P\rangle\rightarrow\langle
V_\beta;\in,P\rangle$. Vopěnka's principle quite obviously implies
this. The reason the converse holds is because every elementary
embedding can be "encoded" (in a sense) into one of these. For more
information, see {% cite Kanamori2009 %}.

## Other points to note

Whilst Vopěnka cardinals are very strong in terms of consistency
strength, a Vopěnka cardinal need not even be [weakly
compact](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact").
Indeed, the definition of a Vopěnka cardinal is a $\Pi^1_1$ statement
over $V_\kappa$ (Vopěnka's principle itself is $\Pi^1_1$), and
[$\Pi^1_1$-indescribability](Indescribable "Indescribable")
is one of the equivalent definitions of weak compactness. Thus, the
least weakly compact Vopěnka cardinal must have (many) other Vopěnka
cardinals less than it.

## Variants

(Information in this section from
{% cite Bagaria2012 %}, a bit from
{% cite Bagaria2017a %})

(Boldface) $VP(\mathbf{Σ_n})$ denotes the fragment of Vopěnka’s
Principle for $Σ_n$-definable classes and (lightface) $VP(Σ_n)$ is the
weaker principle, where parameters are not allowed in the definition of
the class (with analogous definitions for $Π_n$ and $∆_n$).

Vopěnka-like principles $VP(κ, \mathbf{Σ_n})$ for cardinal $κ$ state
that for every proper class $\mathcal{C}$ of structures of the same
type that is $Σ_n$-definable with parameters in $H_κ$ (the collection
of all sets of hereditary size less than $κ$), $\mathcal{C}$ reflects
below $κ$, namely for every $A ∈ C$ there is $B ∈ H_κ ∩ C$ that
elementarily embeds into $A$.

Results:

-   For every $Γ$, $VP(κ, Γ)$ for some $κ$ implies $VP(Γ)$.
-   $VP(κ, \mathbf{Σ_1})$ holds for every uncountable cardinal $κ$.
-   $VP(Π_1) \iff VP(κ, Σ_2)$ for some $κ \iff$ There is a
    [supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact")
    cardinal.
-   $VP(\mathbf{Π_1}) \iff VP(κ, \mathbf{Σ_2})$ for a proper class
    of cardinals $κ \iff$ There is a proper class of supercompact
    cardinals.
-   For $n ≥ 1$, the following are equivalent:
    -   $VP(Π_{n+1})$
    -   $VP(κ, \mathbf{Σ_{n+2}})$ for some $κ$
    -   There is a
        $C(n)$-[extendible](Extendible "Extendible")
        cardinal.
-   The following are equivalent:
    -   $VP(Π_n)$ for every n.
    -   $VP(κ, \mathbf{Σ_n})$ for a proper class of cardinals $κ$ and
        for every $n$.
    -   $VP$
    -   For every $n$, there is a $C(n)$-extendible cardinal.

### Generic

(Information in this section from
{% cite Bagaria2017a %} unless
noted otherwise)

Definitions:

-   The **Generic Vopěnka’s Principle** states that for every proper
    class $\mathcal{C}$ of structures of the same type there are $B ≠
    A$, both in $\mathcal{C}$, such that $B$ elementarily embeds into
    $A$ in some set-forcing extension.
-   (Boldface) $gVP(\mathbf{Σ_n})$ and (lightface) $gVP(Σ_n)$ (with
    analogous definitions for $Π_n$ and $∆_n$) as well as $gVP(κ,
    \mathbf{Σ_n})$ are generic analogues of corresponding weakenings
    of Vopěnka's principle.
-   For transitive $∈$-structures $B$ and $A$ and elementary embedding
    $j : B → A$, we say that $j$ is *overspilling* if it has a critical
    point and $j(crit(j)) > rank(B)$.
-   The principle $gVP^∗(Σ_n)$ states that for every $Σ_n$-definable
    (without parameters) proper class $\mathcal{C}$ of transitive
    $∈$-structures, there are $B ≠ A$ in $\mathcal{C}$ such that there
    is an overspilling elementary embedding $j : B → A$ in some
    set-forcing extension. ($gVP^∗(Π_n)$, $gVP^∗(\mathbf{Π_n})$, and
    $gVP^∗(κ, \mathbf{Σ_n})$ are defined analogously.)

Results:

-   The following are equiconsistent:
    -   $gVP(Π_n)$
    -   $gVP(κ, \mathbf{Σ_{n+1}})$ for some $κ$
    -   There is an
        <a href="N-remarkable" class="mw-redirect" title="N-remarkable">$n$-remarkable</a>
        cardinal.
-   The following are equiconsistent:
    -   $gVP(\mathbf{Π_n})$
    -   $gVP(κ, \mathbf{Σ_{n+1}})$ for a proper class of $κ$
    -   There is a proper class of $n$-remarkable cardinals.
-   $κ$ is the least for which $gVP^∗(κ, \mathbf{Σ_{n+1}})$ holds.
    $\iff κ$ is the least $n$-remarkable cardinal.
-   If $gVP^∗(Π_n)$, then there is an $n$-remarkable cardinal.
-   If $gVP^∗(\mathbf{Π_n})$ holds, then there is a proper class of
    $n$-remarkable cardinals.
-   If there is a proper class of $n$-remarkable cardinals, then
    $gVP(Σ_{n+1})$
    holds.{% cite Gitman2018 %}
-   If $gVP(Σ_{n+1})$ holds, then either there is a proper class of
    $n$-remarkable cardinals or there is a proper class of
    <a href="Rank-into-rank" class="mw-redirect" title="Rank-into-rank">virtually rank-into-rank</a>
    cardinals.{% cite Gitman2018 %}
-   If
    <a href="Zero_sharp" class="mw-redirect" title="Zero sharp">$0^\#$ exists</a>,
    then $L$, equipped with only its definable classes, is a model of
    $gVP$. (By [elementary-embedding absoluteness
    results](Elementary_embedding#Absoluteness "Elementary embedding").
    The hypothesis can be weakened, because one can chop at off the
    universe at any Silver indiscernible and use
    reflection.){% cite Gitman2018 %}
-   The generic Vopěnka scheme is equivalent over ZFC to the scheme
    asserting of every definable class $A$ that there is a proper class
    of weakly virtually
    $A$-[extendible](Extendible "Extendible")
    cardinals.{% cite Gitman2018 %}

Open problems:

-   Must there be an $n$-remarkable cardinal
    -   if $gVP(κ, \mathbf{Σ_{n+1}})$ holds for some $κ$.
    -   if $gVP(Π_n)$ holds.
