The *continuum* is the cardinality of the reals $\mathbb{R}$, and is
variously denoted $\frak{c}$, $2^{\aleph_0}$, $\|\mathbb{R}\|$,
$\beth_1$, $2^\omega$.

## Continuum hypothesis

The *continuum hypothesis* is the assertion that the continuum is the
same as the first uncountable cardinal
<a href="Aleph_one" class="mw-redirect" title="Aleph one">$\aleph_1$</a>.
The *generalized continuum hypothesis* is the assertion that for any
infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the power set $P(\kappa)$ has the same
cardinality as the
<a href="Successor" class="mw-redirect" title="Successor">successor</a>
cardinal $\kappa^+$. This is equivalent, by transfinite induction, to
the assertion that $\aleph_\alpha=\beth_\alpha$ for every ordinal
$\alpha$.
