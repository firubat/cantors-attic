An ordinal $\gamma$ is *admissible* if the $L_\gamma$ level of the
[constructible
universe](Constructible_universe "Constructible universe")
satisfies the
[Kripke-Platek](Kripke-Platek "Kripke-Platek")
axioms of set theory.

The smallest admissible ordinal is
[$\omega_1^{ck}$](Church-Kleene "Church-Kleene"), {% cite Madore2017 %}
the least non-computable ordinal. More generally, for any real $x$, the
least ordinal not computable from $x$ is denoted $\omega_1^x$, and is
also admissible. Indeed, one has
$L_{\omega_1^x}\[x\]\models\text{KP}$.

The smallest limit of admissible ordinals, $\omega_\omega^{ck}$, is
not admissible. {% cite Madore2017 %}

## Computably inaccessible ordinal

An ordinal $\alpha$ is *computably inaccessible*, also known as
*recursively inaccessible*, if it is admissible and a limit of
admissible ordinals. {% cite Madore2017 %}

## Recursively Mahlo and further

An ordinal $α$ is *recursively Mahlo* iff for any $α$-recursive function
$f : α → α$ there is an admissible $β < α$ closed under
$f$. {% cite Madore2017 %}

There are also *recursively weakly compact* i.e. *$Π_3$-reflecting* or
*2-admissible* ordinals. {% cite Madore2017 %}

The smallest $Σ_2$-admissible ordinal is greater then the smallest

ordinal and weaker variants of
[stable](Stable "Stable")
ordinals but smaller than the height of the
<a href="Transitive_ZFC_model" class="mw-redirect" title="Transitive ZFC model">minimal model of ZFC</a>
(if it exists). {% cite Madore2017 %}
