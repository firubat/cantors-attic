*Positive set theory* is the name of a certain group of axiomatic set
theories originally created as an example of a (nonstandard) set
theories in which the axiom of foundation fails (e.g. there exists $x$
such that $x\in x$).
{% cite Forti1989 %} Those
theories are based on a weakening of the (inconsistent) *comprehension
axiom* of
<a href="index.php?title=Naive_set_theory&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Naive set theory (page does not exist)">naive set theory</a>
(which asserts that every formula $\phi(x)$ defines a set that contains
all $x$ such that $\phi(x)$) by restraining the formulas used to a
smaller class of formulas called *positive* formulas.

While most positive set theories are weaker than
[$\text{ZFC}$](ZFC "ZFC")
(and usually mutually interpretable with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/second-order_arithmetic" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:second-order arithmetic">second-order arithmetic</a>),
one of them, $\text{GPK}^+_\infty$ turns out to be very powerful,
being mutually interpretable with
<a href="Morse-Kelley_set_theory" class="mw-redirect" title="Morse-Kelley set theory">Morse-Kelley set theory</a>
plus an axiom asserting that the class of all
[ordinals](Ordinal "Ordinal")
is [weakly
compact](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact").

## Positive formulas

In the first-order language $\{=,\in\}$, we define a *BPF formula*
(bounded positive formula) the following way
{% cite Esser1997 %}: For
every variable $x$, $y$ and BPF formulas $\varphi$, $\psi$,

-   $x=y$ and $x\in y$ are BPF.
-   $\varphi\land\psi$, $\varphi\lor\psi$, $\exists x\varphi$
    and $(\forall x\in y)\varphi$ are BPF.

A formula is then a *GPF formula* (generalized positive formula) if it
is a BPF formula or if it is of the form $\forall
x(\theta(x)\Rightarrow\varphi)$ with $\theta(x)$ a GPF formula with
exactly one free variable $x$ and no parameter and $\varphi$ is a GPF
formula (possibly with parameters). {% cite Esser1996 %}

## $\text{GPK}$ positive set theories

The positive set theory $\text{GPK}$ consists of the following axioms:

-   **Empty set**: $\exists x\forall y(y\not\in x)$.
-   **Extensionality**: $\forall x\forall
    y(x=y\Leftrightarrow\forall z(z\in x\Leftrightarrow z\in y))$.
-   **GPF comprehension**: the universal closure of $\exists x\forall
    y(y\in x\Leftrightarrow\varphi)$ for every GPF formula $\varphi$
    (with parameters) in which $x$ does not occur.

The empty set axiom is necessary, as without it the theory would hold in
the trivial model which has only one element satisfying $x=\{x\}$.
Note that, while $\text{GPK}$ do proves the existence of a set such
that $x\in x$, Olivier Esser proved that it refutes the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-foundation_axiom" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:anti-foundation axiom">anti-foundation axiom</a>
(AFA). {% cite Esser1996 %}

The theory $\text{GPK}^+$ is obtained by adding the following axiom:

-   **Closure**: the universal closure of $\exists x(\forall
    z(\varphi(z)\Rightarrow z\in x)\land\forall y(\forall
    z(\varphi(z)\Rightarrow z\in y)\Rightarrow x\subset y))$ for
    every formula $\varphi(z)$ (not necessarily BPF or GPF) with a free
    variable $z$ (and possibly parameters) such that $x$ does not occur
    in $\varphi$.

This axiom scheme asserts that for any (possibly proper) class
$C=\{x\|\varphi(x)\}$ there is a smallest set $X$ containing $C$,
i.e. $C\subset X$ and for all sets $Y$ such that $C\subset Y$, one has
$X\subset Y$. {% cite Esser1999 %}

Note that replacing GPF comprehension in $\text{GPK}^+$ by BPF
comprehension does not make the theory any weaker: BPF comprehension
plus Closure implies GPF comprehension.

Both $\text{GPK}$ and $\text{GPK}^+$ are consistent relative to
$\text{ZFC}$, in fact mutually interpretable with second-order
arithmetic. However a much stronger theory,
**$\text{GPK}^+_\infty$**, is obtained by adding the following axiom:

-   **Infinity**: the von Neumann ordinal $\omega$ is a set.

By "von Neumann ordinal" we mean the usual definition of ordinals as
well-ordered-by-inclusion sets containing all the smaller ordinals. Here
$\omega$ is the set of all finite ordinals (the natural numbers). The
point of this axiom is not implying the existence of an infinite set;
the *class* $\omega$ exists, so it has a set closure which is
certainely infinite. This set closure happens to satisfy the usual axiom
of infinity of $\text{ZFC}$ (i.e. it contains 0 and the successor of
all its members) but in $\text{GPK}^+$ this is not enough to deduce
that $\omega$ itself is a set (an improper class).

Olivier Esser showed that $\text{GPK}^+_\infty$ can not only
interpret $\text{ZFC}$ (and prove it consistent), but is in fact
mutually interpretable with a *much* stronger set theory, namely,
Morse-Kelley set theory with an axiom asserting that the (proper) class
of all ordinals is [weakly
compact](Weakly_compact "Weakly compact").
This theory is powerful enough to prove, for instance, that there exists
a proper class of
[hyper-Mahlo](Mahlo "Mahlo")
cardinals.
