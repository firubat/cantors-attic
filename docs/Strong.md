Strong cardinals were created as a weakening of [supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact") cardinals introduced by Dodd and Jensen in 1982 {% cite Jech2003 %}. They are defined as a strengthening of [measurability](Measurable "Measurable"), being that they are critical points of [elementary embeddings](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding") $j:V\rightarrow M$ for some transitive inner model of [ZFC](ZFC "ZFC") $M$. Hypermeasurability is a weakening of strongness (the property of being a strong cardinal is often called strongness), although if $\lambda=\beth_\lambda$ then a cardinal is $\lambda$-strong iff it is $\lambda$-hypermeasurable.

## Definitions of Strongness

There are multiple equivalent definitions of strongness, using [elementary embeddings](Elementary_embedding "Elementary embedding") and <a href="index.php?title=Extender&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Extender (page does not exist)">extenders</a>.

### Elementary Embedding Characterization

A cardinal $\kappa$ is **$\gamma$-strong** iff it is the critical point of some elementary embedding $j:V\rightarrow M$ for some transitive class $M$ such that $V_\gamma\subset M$. 
A cardinal $\kappa$ is **strong** iff it is $\gamma$-strong for each $\gamma$, 
	iff it is $\gamma$-strong for arbitrarily large $\gamma$, 
	iff for each set $x$, $\kappa$ is the critical point of some elementary embedding $j:V\rightarrow M$ for some transitive class $M$ such that $x\in M$. 

More intuitively, there are elementary embeddings from $V$ into transitive classes which have critical point $\kappa$ and (in total) contain any set one wishes.

### Extender Characterization

A cardinal $\kappa$ is **strong** iff it is <a href="Uncountable" class="mw-redirect" title="Uncountable">uncountable</a> and for every set $X$ of rank $\lambda\geq\kappa$, there is a $(\kappa,\beth_\lambda^+)$-extender $E$ such that, letting the [ultrapower](Ultrapower "Ultrapower") of $V$ by $E$ be called $Ult_E$ and the canonical ultrapower embedding from $V$ to $Ult_E$ be called $j$, $X\in Ult_E$ and $\lambda\lt j(\kappa)$. {% cite Jech2003 %} 

Once again, a more intuitive way to think about strongness is that there are many $(\kappa,\lambda)$-extenders $E$.

## Definitions of Hypermeasurability

The definitions of hypermeasurability are very similar to the definitions of strongness, mainly because hypermeasurability is a generalized version of strongness. The intuition behind each definition is also very similar to that of the matching definitions of strongness.

### Elementary Embedding Characterization

A cardinal $\kappa$ is **$x$-hypermeasurable** for a set $x$ iff it is the critical point of some elementary embedding $j:V\rightarrow M$ for some transitive class $M$ such that $x\in M$. A cardinal $\kappa$ is **$\lambda$-hypermeasurable** iff it is $H_\lambda$-hypermeasurable (where $H_\lambda$ is the set of all sets of [hereditary cardinality](Hereditary_Cardinality "Hereditary Cardinality") less than $\lambda$).

Note that a cardinal is $\gamma$-strong iff it is $x$-hypermeasurable for every $x\in V_\gamma$ (iff it is $V_\gamma$-hypermeasurable as well) and a cardinal is strong iff it is $x$-hypermeasurable for every $x$.

## Facts about Strongness and Hypermeasurability

Here is a list of facts about these cardinals:

-   A cardinal $\kappa$ is $\gamma$-strong if and only if $\kappa$ is $\beth_\gamma$-hypermeasurable, by definition.
-   In particular, $\kappa$ is $\mathcal{P}^2(\kappa)$-hypermeasurable if and only if it is $\kappa+2$-strong. This hypothesis appears in many theorems.
-   A cardinal $\kappa$ is [measurable](Measurable "Measurable") if and only if it is $\kappa^+$-hypermeasurable, since $\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\subset M$ for any $j:V\to M$ with critical point $\kappa$.
-   If there is an $x$-hypermeasurable cardinal, then $V\neq L\[x\]$. {% cite Jech2003 %}
-   Every [supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact") cardinal $\kappa$ is strong and has $\kappa$ strong cardinals below it, as well as being a stationary limit of $\{\lambda\lt\kappa:\lambda$ is strong$\}$
-   The [Mitchell rank](Mitchell_rank "Mitchell rank") of any strong cardinal $o(\kappa)=(2^\kappa)^+$. {% cite Jech2003 %}
-   Any strong cardinal is [$\Sigma_2$-reflecting](Reflecting "Reflecting"). {% cite Jech2003 %}
-   Every strong cardinal is [strongly unfoldable](Unfoldable "Unfoldable") and thus [totally indescribable](Indescribable "Indescribable"). {% cite Gitman2011 %} Therefore, each of
    the following is never strong:
    -   The least [measurable](Measurable "Measurable") cardinal.
    -   The least $\kappa$ which is [$2^\kappa$-supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact"), the least $\kappa$ which is [$2^{2^\kappa}$-supercompact](Supercompact "Supercompact"), etc.
    -   For each $n$, the least [$n$-huge](Huge "Huge") index cardinal (that is, the least *target* of an embedding witnessing $n$-hugeness of some cardinal) and the least $n$-huge cardinal.
    -   For each $n\lt\omega$, The least $\kappa$ such that there is some embedding $j:V_{\lambda+n}\prec V_{\kappa+n}$ with critical point $\lambda$ for some $\lambda\lt\kappa$ (see [$n$-extendible](Extendible "Extendible")).
    -   The least $\kappa$ which is both $2^\kappa$-supercompact and [Vopěnka](Vopenka "Vopenka"), the least $\kappa$ which is both $2^{2^\kappa}$-supercompact and Vopěnka, etc., the least $\kappa$ which is both measurable and Vopěnka, for each $n$ the least Vopěnka $\kappa$ such that there is some embedding $j:V_{\lambda+n}\prec V_{\kappa+n}$ with critical point $\lambda$ for some $\lambda\lt\kappa$, and more.
-   If there is a strong cardinal then $V\neq L[A]$ for every set $A$.
-   Assuming both a strong cardinal and a [superstrong](Superstrong "Superstrong") cardinal exist, and the least strong cardinal $\kappa$ has a superstrong above it, then the least strong cardinal has $\kappa$ superstrong cardinals below it.
-   Every strong cardinal is tall. The existence of a tall cardinal is
    equiconsistent with the existence of a strong cardinal.
-   A cardinal $κ$ is
    <a href="Correct" class="mw-redirect" title="Correct">$C^{(n)}$-strong</a>
    iff for every $λ \gt κ$, $κ$ is $λ$-$C^{(n)}$-strong, that is,
    there exists an elementary embedding $j : V → M$ for transitive $M$,
    with $crit(j) = κ$, $j(κ) \gt λ$, $V_λ ⊆ M$ and $j(κ) ∈ C^{(n)}$.
    -   Equivalently (see {% cite Kanamori2009 %}
        26.7), κ is $λ$-$C^{(n)}$-strong iff there exists a $(κ,
        β)$-extender $E$, for some $β \gt \|V_λ\|$, with $V_λ ⊆ M_E$
        and $λ \lt j_E(κ) ∈ C^{(n)}$.
    -   Every $λ$-strong cardinal is $λ$-$C^{(n)}$-strong for all $n$.
        Hence, every strong cardinal is $C^{(n)}$-strong for all
        $n$.{% cite Bagaria2012 %}

## Core Model up to Strongness

Dodd and Jensen created a [core
model](Core_model "Core model")
based on sequences of
<a href="index.php?title=Extender&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Extender (page does not exist)">extenders</a>
of strong cardinals. They constructed a sequence of extenders
$\mathcal{E}$ such that: {% cite Jech2003 %}

-   <a href="L" class="mw-redirect" title="L">$L[\mathcal{E}]$</a>
    is an inner model of
    [ZFC](ZFC "ZFC").
-   $L\[\mathcal{E}\]$ satisfies
    <a href="GCH" class="mw-redirect" title="GCH">GCH</a>,
    the square principle, and the existence of a $\Sigma_3^1$
    well-ordering of $\mathbb{R}$.
-   $L\[\mathcal{E}\]$ satisfies that $\mathcal{E}$ witnesses the
    existence of a strong cardinal
-   If there does not exist an inner model of the existence of a strong
    cardinal, then:
    -   There is no nontrivial elementary embedding
        $j:L\[\mathcal{E}\]\rightarrow L\[\mathcal{E}\]$
    -   If $\kappa$ is a singular [strong
        limit](Beth "Beth")
        cardinal then $(\kappa^+)^{L\[\mathcal{E}\]}=\kappa^+$

As one can see, $L\[\mathcal{E}\]$ is a core model up to strongness.
Dodd and Jensen also constructed a "sharp" defined analogously to
<a href="Zero_sharp" class="mw-redirect" title="Zero sharp">$0^{\#}$</a>,
but instead of using $L$ one uses $L\[\mathcal{E}\]$. They then showed
that there is a nontrivial elementary embedding
$j:L\[\mathcal{E}\]\rightarrow L\[\mathcal{E}\]$ iff such a real
exists. {% cite Jech2003 %} This real is commonly
referred to as *the sharp for a strong cardinal*.
